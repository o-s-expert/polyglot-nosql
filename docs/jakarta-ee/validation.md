# Jakarta Validation

In this new training segment, we will dive into Jakarta Validation's importance in integrating Java with NoSQL databases, specifically Bean Validation. Jakarta Validation is pivotal in ensuring data consistency, mainly when dealing with schemaless databases.

NoSQL databases, known for their flexibility, often need more rigid data schemas. While this flexibility is advantageous, it can also introduce challenges in maintaining data integrity. It is where Jakarta Validation comes to the rescue. 

Imagine a scenario where you must ensure that email addresses are valid and consistent across all records or that the format of dates like birthdays remains uniform. Jakarta Validation provides the tools and conventions to enforce these rules, guaranteeing data quality and integrity in your NoSQL database, even when dealing with unstructured or schemaless data.

Jakarta Validation becomes an indispensable tool in your toolkit, allowing you to establish and enforce data validation rules consistently, ensuring that your Java applications interact seamlessly with NoSQL databases while maintaining data quality and reliability. As we delve deeper into this topic, you'll discover how Jakarta Validation can be effectively utilized to meet your specific data validation needs in NoSQL integration.

Here's a table showcasing some of the main validation annotations available in Jakarta Validation (Bean Validation):


| Annotation                 | Description                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `@NotNull`                 | Ensures that a field or parameter is not null.       |
| `@Size(min, max)`          | Validates the size of a string, collection, or array.|
| `@Min(value)`              | Validates that a number is greater than or equal to the specified minimum. |
| `@Max(value)`              | Validates that a number is less than or equal to the specified maximum. |
| `@DecimalMin(value)`       | Validates that a decimal number is greater than or equal to the specified minimum value. |
| `@DecimalMax(value)`       | Validates that a decimal number is less than or equal to the specified maximum value. |
| `@Pattern(regex)`          | Validates that a string matches the specified regular expression pattern. |
| `@Email`                   | Validates that a string is a well-formed email address. |
| `@Past`                    | Ensures that a date or time is in the past.          |
| `@Future`                  | Ensures that a date or time is in the future.        |
| `@AssertTrue`              | Validates that a boolean value is true.              |
| `@AssertFalse`             | Validates that a boolean value is false.             |
| `@NotBlank`                | Ensures that a string is not null and contains at least one non-whitespace character. |

These annotations are commonly used to enforce validation rules for various data types in Java applications.
