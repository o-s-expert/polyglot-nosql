# CDI

In our journey toward seamlessly integrating Java with NoSQL databases for modern applications, we come across an indispensable tool called CDI, or Contexts and Dependency Injection. CDI is more than just an acronym; it represents a paradigm shift in managing dependencies, promoting reusability, and elevating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to new heights in enterprise development.

At its core, CDI is a specification within the Jakarta EE ecosystem that simplifies how we create, manage, and inject dependencies in our Java applications. It allows us to embrace the principles of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), pivotal in developing robust, modular, and maintainable code.

You might wonder, "Why is CDI so crucial when working with NoSQL databases in modern applications?" Let's explore a few compelling reasons:

**1. Decoupling and Flexibility:** CDI enables us to decouple components, making our applications more flexible and adaptable. This flexibility becomes paramount when integrating with NoSQL databases, which often involve handling diverse data models. CDI allows us to swap out database implementations or adapt to schema changes with minimal impact on the rest of our application.

**2. Scalability and Testability:** Modern applications demand scalability and robust testing. CDI promotes using design patterns like Singleton, which are instrumental in managing resources efficiently and achieving scalability. Additionally, it simplifies the testing process by allowing us to easily replace real implementations with mock objects during unit testing, ensuring our code is reliable and maintainable.

**3. Enhanced Object-Oriented Programming:** CDI takes the principles of OOP to another level. It encourages the use of well-defined interfaces, key to building modular and reusable components. By adhering to CDI practices, we can create cleaner, more understandable code that's easier to extend and maintain.

**4. Loose Coupling:** CDI promotes loose Coupling between components. In the context of NoSQL integration, where database structures can evolve rapidly, this loose Coupling ensures that changes to the database schema don't ripple through the entire application. We can adapt our data access components independently, avoiding cascading changes and reducing the risk of bugs.


## CDI Scope


| CDI Scope                   | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dependent**               | The shortest-lived scope, tied to the lifecycle of the bean that declares it. Dependent beans are created and destroyed each time they are injected or requested. |
| **Request**                 | Scoped to an HTTP request in a web application. The bean instance is created for the duration of an HTTP request and destroyed when the request is completed. |
| **Session**                 | Scoped to an HTTP session in a web application. The bean instance is created when the session is initiated and destroyed when the session ends. |
| **Application**             | Scoped to the entire lifecycle of the application. The bean instance is created when the application starts and destroyed when the application is shut down. |
| **Conversation**            | Scoped to a long-running conversation in a web application. It spans multiple HTTP requests and allows maintaining a conversational state. The bean instance is created at the beginning of a conversation and destroyed when the conversation ends. |
| **Singleton**               | Scoped to a single, shared instance across the entire application. The same bean instance is reused for all clients, promoting a global state and sharing among components. |


These CDI scopes provide a powerful mechanism for managing the lifecycle and visibility of beans in your application, allowing you to control how and when dependencies are created and maintained. The choice of scope depends on the specific requirements of your application and how you want to manage bean instances and their interactions.


## The main CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) feature with brief descriptions:

| CDI Feature                | Description                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dependency Injection**   | Automatic injection of dependencies into components, simplifying the management of resources like NoSQL database clients or DAOs. |
| **Scopes**                 | Definition of bean lifecycles, allowing you to manage the duration and visibility of beans, such as NoSQL database connections. |
| **Interceptors**           | Creation of interceptors to apply cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) to methods, enhancing NoSQL database access logic. |
| **Alternatives**           | Configuration of alternative bean implementations, facilitating the flexibility to switch between different NoSQL database providers or configurations. |
| **Producers**              | Implementation of producer methods to dynamically create and manage instances of beans, including NoSQL database connections. |
| **Event**                  | CDI's event mechanism enables communication between loosely coupled components by allowing one component to fire events and others to observe and react to them. This can be used to trigger actions based on NoSQL database changes or updates. |
