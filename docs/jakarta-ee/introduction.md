# Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, data has become the lifeblood of businesses, powering applications and services that cater to the ever-evolving needs of users. In the realm of Java-based application development, the integration between Java and NoSQL databases has emerged as a critical component. To harness the full potential of this integration, the Jakarta EE platform plays a pivotal role.

Jakarta EE, formerly known as Java EE (Enterprise Edition), is an open-source, community-driven platform for building enterprise-level Java applications. It provides a robust, scalable, and portable foundation for developing and deploying mission-critical applications. While Jakarta EE covers a wide spectrum of functionalities, its relevance to the world of NoSQL databases is particularly noteworthy. Here are some key reasons why Jakarta EE is essential in the Java-NoSQL integration landscape:

1. **Standardization**: Jakarta EE standardizes Java-based enterprise applications, ensuring seamless integration with various NoSQL databases.

2. **Extensibility**: The platform allows developers to extend its capabilities to accommodate specific NoSQL database requirements, fostering innovation.

3. **Scalability**: Jakarta EE complements the scalability of NoSQL databases, offering features for building scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications.

4. **Flexibility**: It supports various programming models, such as microservices and serverless architectures, adapting to different NoSQL database use cases.

5. **Community Support**: Jakarta EE benefits from an active community committed to keeping it up-to-date with the latest NoSQL database technologies, making it a reliable choice for enterprises.

Eclipse MicroProfile is a complementary open-source project to Jakarta EE, designed for microservices development in Java. While Jakarta EE excels at building enterprise-level applications, MicroProfile offers lightweight APIs tailored for microservices, including features like RESTful services, fault tolerance, and health checks. The two technologies work together seamlessly, allowing developers to leverage Jakarta EE for robust enterprise components and MicroProfile for agile microservices development, resulting in a versatile and scalable Java-based solution.

This initial segment of the workshop marks the foundational phase, and it's crucial for a specific reason â€“ these components, namely JAX-RS, CDI, and validation, form the core building blocks of any integration we will explore further in this training. Understanding these technologies is akin to mastering the toolkit that empowers you to integrate Java applications with NoSQL databases seamlessly. As we progress through the workshop, you'll find that these fundamentals are essential for unlocking the full potential of Jakarta EE in NoSQL integration scenarios. They lay the groundwork upon which we will build more advanced and specialized skills, ultimately enabling you to create robust, data-driven solutions that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape of modern application development.
